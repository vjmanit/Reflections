When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    When two or more  users are working on a project seperately we should use a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Changes are the reason for conflicts.Suppose you want to add a feature and that consist of several commits and you have done many of the commits but not all and took the rest for sometime.Automatic pull will update to all the users working on a project and they may work on that feature that may cause conflict.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	fork-it is used to directly clone from one github account to another
	clone-it is used to clone from one github account our pc
	branches-it is used for changing in a file seperately with more than one branchs and we can push or pop any of the branches from github or your local git. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	You can work offline, it saves a lot of data overhead when pushing changes to github and it gives the possibility to do a quick check which changes are made in the online repo compared to the offline repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Without using git and github we can collaborate using emails.There is only advantage of not using git or github is that we don't have to learn how to use git or github but it is harder to control version without using github.
